How to Use the MMA7455 Arduino Library

The MMA7455 has a number of settings, which can be configured based on user requirements.
          
1.Address calling:The following command is used to set call the address of MMA7455 sensor to begin the transmission.

            mma.getAddr_MMA7455(MMA7455_DEFAULT_ADDRESS_ACCEL);        // 0x1D
            
2.Output range selection:The following command is used to select the output range of accelometer.

            mma.setAccelRange(ACCEL_RANGE_2G);               // 2 g;
